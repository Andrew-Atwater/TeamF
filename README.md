PROBLEM STATEMENT #1:
Every year, thousands of UMaine students are faced with financial dilemmas. For example, should I stay on campus or find off campus housing? Should I buy a meal plan or buy groceries and cook for myself? How do I manage my budget and account for payment due dates / biweekly deposits for income? 

It can be very hard for them to find the right tool to manage their finances. Not all students are good at spreadsheet calculations, and even those who are might not have the time to run the numbers and make informed decisions. There are very good budgeting tools offered by services like NerdWallet and Rocket Mortgage. They can be extremely helpful for adults trying to manage their finances, especially ones who are in complex financial situations. However, college students have much less experience with personal finance, and oftentimes find these tools hard and very time consuming to use. This void in a simple, quick, and easy budgeting tool geared towards UMaine college students can lead to students making financial decisions that they regret later on. How can students figure out answers to their financial questions quickly through a simple and effective tool that will enable them to make informed choices with their finances?
