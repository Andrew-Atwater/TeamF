PROBLEM STATEMENT #1:
Every year, thousands of UMaine students are faced with financial dilemmas. For example, should I stay on campus or find off campus housing? Should I buy a meal plan or buy groceries and cook for myself? How do I manage my budget and account for payment due dates / biweekly deposits for income? 

It can be very hard for them to find the right tool to manage their finances. Not all students are good at spreadsheet calculations, and even those who are might not have the time to run the numbers and make informed decisions. Even still, there are students who have not been taught the necessary financial literacy skills to manage their finances on their own. There are very in-depth, popular, and useful budgeting tools offered by services like NerdWallet and Rocket Mortgage; they can be extremely helpful for adults trying to manage their finances, especially ones who are in complex financial situations. However, college students have much less experience with personal finance, and often find these tools hard and very time consuming to use. On top of this, many large budgeting aid services have features that simply do not apply to students, such as mortgage, insurance, etc., as well as most of them having options to pay a monthly fee to use the service. This lack of a simple, quick, free, and easy budgeting tool geared towards UMaine college students can lead to students making financial decisions that they regret later on. How can students figure out answers to their financial questions quickly through a simple and effective tool that will enable them to make informed choices with their finances?


PROBLEM STATEMENT #2: 
Managing personal finances as a college student can be overwhelming, with income sources, expenses, and financial obligations to track. Existing budgeting tools like Goodbudget, EveryDollar, and NerdWallet often require bank connections, are overly complex, and include unnecessary features that don't cater to student needs. 

Our goal is to create a simple, user-friendly financial planning tool tailored specifically for UMaine students. Unlike common budgeting apps, we eliminate unnecessary complexity—no bank connections, no hidden fees—just straightforward financial tracking. Students easily input income sources like cash, biweekly paychecks, and expenses while automatically scheduling key due dates for rent, tuition, and credit card payments. Designed with college-specific needs in mind, we account for meal plan costs, off-campus vs. on-campus expenses, and gas vs. housing trade-offs. 

To make budgeting even easier, students can import data from Excel/CSV, upload receipts, and sign in with Google for seamless access. A biweekly paycheck scheduler will help break down tax deductions and encourage savings without the hassle. By focusing on simplicity, transparency, and student financial needs, our solution will provide a stress-free alternative to complicated budgeting apps, empowering students to take control of their finances with ease.
